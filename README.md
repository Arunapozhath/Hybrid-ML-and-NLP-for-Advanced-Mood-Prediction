# Hybrid-ML-and-NLP-for-Advanced-Mood-Prediction
This project predicts mood using a hybrid ML approach with NLP. It utilizes BERT for sentiment analysis, LSTM for time series, and regressor models for forecasting. Data is stored in MySQL, visualized in Tableau, and accessed via a Streamlit GUI. SHAP and LIME ensure model interpretability.
